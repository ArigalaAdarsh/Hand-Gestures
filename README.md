# Hand-Gesture Detection

## Overview

This is an open-source project focused on face and hand gesture detection using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a robust system capable of recognizing and interpreting facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time using OpenCV.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection:**
  - The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascades or deep learning-based models.
  
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:**
  - Real-time hand gesture detection using a combination of hand tracking and classification algorithms to interpret gestures.

- **Interactive System:**
  - Provides an interactive interface that responds to detected gestures, allowing users to control certain functions based on their hand movements.

- **Facial Expression Recognition:**
  - In addition to hand gestures, the system can detect facial expressions, adding an extra layer of interaction.

- **OpenCV Integration:**
  - Built with OpenCV for efficient image processing and real-time detection of gestures.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Machine Learning:** Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe (for hand and face detection)
- **Programming Language:** Python
